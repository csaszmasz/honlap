<P align=center>Tyler Deron Lockett (born September 28, 1992) is an American football wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Seahawks in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He played college football at Kansas State. In college, he set numerous Kansas State football records and was both a 2011 All-American (as a kickoff returner) and 2014 College Football All-America Team consensus All-American selection (as a punt returner). In college, he totaled 6,586 career all-purpose yards and 35 touchdowns, including 3,710 yards and 29 touchdowns as a receiver.
Through the first nine games of his freshman College season for the  2011 Wildcats, Lockett led the nation in average yards per kickoff return, but he was injured and missed the rest of the season. Nonetheless, he was afterward recognized as an All-American return specialist. In 2012, he was an honorable mention All-Big 12 performer for the 2012 team. In 2013, he was a first team All-Big 12 performer for the 2013 team at both wide receiver and all-purpose receiver. That season, he established Kansas State school records for single-game receiving yards, single game all-purpose yards and career kickoff return yards. As a senior for the 2014 team, he surpassed his own father's school records for career receiving yards, career receptions and career receiving touchdowns. As a senior, he was the Big 12 Conference leader in receiving yards and the national leader in punt return average.
